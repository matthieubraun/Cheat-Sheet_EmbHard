\subsection*{Nios II}
\underline{NIOS II:}\\
a soft-core processor that can be implemented on Altera FPGA devices. It has a 32-bit RISC architecture and supports instruction and data caches, hardware multipliers, and custom instructions.\\
\underline{Avalon bus:}\\
a standard interface for connecting components in a SOPC. It supports different types of transfers, such as basic, burst, pipelined, and latency-tolerant. It also supports multiple masters and slaves, and provides signals for address, data, byte enable, wait request, and read data valid.\\
\underline{Embedded system on FPGA:}\\
are systems that integrates a NIOS II processor, memory, peripherals, and custom logic on a single FPGA chip. It has the advantages of fast implementation, modular architecture, affordable system complexity, reuse of existing IP cores, ease of development, and adaptability.

%NIOS II is a softcore processor from Altera that can be synthesized by a compiler and placed and routed on the FPGA. It has a 32-bit architecture with 256 instructions available for user implementation. There are three basic configurable architectures: Nios II/f, Nios II/s, and Nios II/e. The processor can be extended by user own instructions, up to 256. The ALU can be extended by custom user instructions, which can have access to all the FPGA resources. For cycles consuming operations, a hardware accelerator can be included/developed. The Avalon bus is a multi-master, synchronous bus that supports concurrent master-slave access. The ChipSelect is generated by the Avalon bus and selects the module. The Address[n .. 0] is used to access a specific register/memory position in the selected module. The Read and Write signals specified the direction of the transfers. They are provided by a Master and received by the slave modules. The direction is the view of the Master unit. The ReadData(..) and WriteData(..) bus transfers the Datas from (read)/ to (write) the Slaves. The master starts a transfer (read or write) and provides the Addresses (32 bits on NIOSII). It waits on WaitRequest signal to resume the transfer. Some positive points of a softcore architecture include fast implementation, modular architecture, affordable system complexity, good documentation, reuse of existing IP cores, ease of development of our own programmable interface on internal bus (i.e. Avalon in VHDL, Verilog), full system on FPGA, easily adaptable, and operating systems available. Some negative points include several complex tools to develop a system: hardware and software specific, and several debugging levels to deal with for hardware and software.

%This is a summary of a programmable parallel port interface design for an Avalon bus as a slave module. The module has a bidirectional port, programmable direction for each bit, and special features for modifying the port bits. The methodology for designing the interface includes identifying inputs-outputs of the interface, defining a register model, and creating the interface architecture. The parallel port module on Avalon has a bidirectional port, and the state value is stored in a register. There are three possible ways to modify the register value: RegPort, RegSet, and RegClr. The register can be read back. The internal signals for register access include iRegDir, iRegPort, and iRegPin. The architecture for the parallel port module includes registers access for write and read, and external interface for parallel port output value and input value.

%DMA stands for Direct Memory Access. It is a more efficient system for transferring data between the I/O and memory when the transfer rate is high. The transfer is carried out by a specialized unit called the DMA controller. The DMA controller performs transfers instead of the processor. DMA must have control of the bus as a Master including Address bus, Data bus and Control signals. The DMA controller is a programmable interface that must be programmed by the processor before it is operational. The DMA unit can be used to transfer data more efficiently than the processor. There are two main types of transfers: Memory to memory and Interface to memory (and vice versa). The DMA controller is a programmable interface. It must therefore be initialized prior to use. Several methods are possible depending on the circuit used: by direct access to internal DMA registers by the processor or by descriptors automatically loaded from memory to the DMA controller by itself. A minimum set of descriptors are available on virtually all DMA controllers: Source Address, Destination Address, Length of data to transfer, Modes of operation, Status of the controller, and Interrupt control.
